            Every wedding has its unforgettable moments, but Harlie and Garrett's was filled with them from start to finish. Filming their day at The Grand Ivory, I was struck by how each interaction told a story of love, support, and commitment.

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl">
            From the early hours, capturing Harlie's interactions with her bridesmaids was a joy. There was laughter, heartfelt exchanges, and a strong bond that made for beautiful, candid shots. Her best friend spoke movingly about Harlie's loyal spirit, which was echoed in every frame. Filming Garrett as he prepared was a reminder of the depth behind their loveâ€”an easy smile, a quiet confidence, and a love that was clear to everyone around him.

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl">
            The ceremony was a powerful moment, not just for the couple but for everyone present. Through my lens, I could see the emotion on every face. When they shared their vows, the weight of each word was visible, and as Garrett kissed Harlie, the joy was contagious.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl">
            Harlie and Garrett, thank you for allowing me to capture the memories of your day. May these moments be a reminder of the love and happiness you felt, captured forever through the lens.
